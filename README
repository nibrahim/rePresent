A simple Emacs major mode that can be used to make presentations. 

The idea is to have different "kinds of slides" (like source code
listings, regular bullet points etc.).

To try it out, simple load the `rePresent-mode.el` file and then use
the `rePresent/load-file` command to load the `sample-presentation.el`
file. It will create two buffers (each of which is a slide). You can
use the PgDn, PgUp keys to incrementally display the bullets.

Features planned. 

   - Slide decks created so that you can go through like a regular PP
     slide.
   - Different kinds of slides (code, title etc.)
   - Embedding images
   - org-mode exporter into rePresent slides so that we can stay
     inside Emacs. 
   - Prettier slide format
